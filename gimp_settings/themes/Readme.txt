General Info
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

These themes are modified versions of Andrew Pullins' brilliant collection
of Gimp 2.8 themes: "Flat Gimp Icon Theme v1.0.0". Those original themes
are available at:
http://android272.deviantart.com/art/Flat-GIMP-icon-Theme-v-1-0-0-375010811

The original themes use orange (#f07746) as their main highlighting-color,
including 8 variants, depending on the colorization of the remaining UI
elements: Darker, Darker small, Dark, Dark small, Light, Light small, Lighter
and Lighter small. The "small" variants use smaller icons and font.

I have modified the 4 middle ones, namely:
	Dark
	Dark small
	Light
	Light small

Moreover, each one of them comes in 5 highlighting-color versions:
	Blue	(#3380b3)
	Orange	(#f07746)
	Pink	(#be006b)
	Red	(#ee2e42)
	Teal	(#008080)

This makes a total of 20 variations. 

Besides the additional highlighting-colors, other modifications include
a bit wider scroll-bars & dragging-handles, along with slightly altered
colorization of menus, tools, panels, tabs, radio buttons, checkboxes, 
tool-tips, etc.

Some 1920x1080 screen-shots are available both in the zip-file of the
distribution and on-line:

These themes are meant to let you focus on your work instead of distracting you.
As Andrew Pullins said, they may also attract more people in using Gimp.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Themes Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The themes come packed in a zip-file. Copy all the folders it contains into
Gimp 2.8's "themes/" folder. Depending on your OS this folder will be one of
the following (assuming you have already installed Gimp 2.8 to the default
path of its installer):

	MS Windows:  C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\share\gimp\2.0\themes\
	        or:  C:\Program Files (x86)\GIMP 2\share\gimp\2.0\themes\

	GNU/Linux :  home/.gimp-2.8/themes

	Mac OSX   :  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R82JfN5tupY

If you are using a different OS, you may need to do some googling.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
--------------
The folder: "_flat_gimp_icons/" MUST be extracted along with the other folders
into Gimp's "themes/" directory, but it is NOT a theme. Rather, it contains all
the data needed by all other themes in this collection. Put it otherwise,
extract it but do NOT select it from within Gimp.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clearlooks GTK2 Theming Engine Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

These themes use the Clearlooks GTK2 theming engine, the Windows version of
which (for both 32-bit & 64-bit architectures) comes as a separate zip-file
inside the main zip-file of the themes. Please extract it and read its separate
Readme.txt for instructions on how to install the engine into your Windows
Gimp 2.8 installation folder.

If you are on GNU/Linux, the Clearlooks engine should be already available
through the GTK+2 runtime. However, modern Linux distros come with GTK3, which
does not use the Clearlooks engine. If that's your case, try installing the
GTK+2 runtime (AFAIK both GTK2 and GTK3 may co-exist, but do it at your own
risk). Or have a look at Clearlooks-Phoenix here :
http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Clearlooks-Phenix?content=145210

If you are on a Mac, you may want to have a look at the following link:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changing Themes from within Gimp 2.8
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Run Gimp 2.8

2. Select the menu command: Edit -> Preferences.

3. In the dialog window that shows up, select: "Theme" from the tree on the
   left, then select the desired theme from the list on the right.

4. Close the dialog window by clicking on its "OK" button.

5. The new theme may be partially displayed on-the-fly, but you really need
   to quit Gimp and re-launch it.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
--------------
The folder: "_flat_gimp_icons/" gets displayed in the list of themes from within
Gimp, but it is NOT a theme. Rather, it contains all the data needed by all
other themes in this collection. Put it otherwise, do NOT select it from within
Gimp.

The themes (along with the bundled Clearlooks engine) have been tested on
WindowsXP SP3 32-bit, Windows7 64-bit & Windows8 64-bit, with Gimp 2.18.14
(both 32-bit & 64-bit versions).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further Modding
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I plan to also modify the "Lighter" & "Lighter small" variants of the original
themes (but it may take a while). However, I do not intend to modify the
"Darker" and "Darker small" variants.

If you like to make your own modifications based on mine, have a look at the
file: "_further_modding.txt" (included in the main zip-file of these themes). 


Enjoy!

PS. Many, many thanks to Andrew Pullins (aka android272) for the beautiful
original themes. And of course many, many thanks to the Gimp devs and the
community.
